          /*
          The client or all clients send requests to see if anything is changed on the server, and this is called periodic refresh. But this may cause the server to be overloaded.
          Here, we use a timeout property of the xhr object where a time period is set, and if a request isn't served in the time period, the request times out and an xhr.ontimeout
          event is triggered.
          When this happens, we code a failed function, to provide user experience, by using the concept of exponential backoff.
          Streaming is done to stop short bursts of data by sending data over one connection by continuous flushing.

            In short polling, the client sends requests to the server continuously without a reply. In this scenario, we keep a connection open from the client to the server. This is called long polling. This is called COMET or Reverse AJAX, where the server sends data.
            In another scenario, COMET or Reverse AJAX is used, where the server asynchronously queries the client.

            Sometimes, it is better to delay multiple requests at the same time and send all of them at once. This is a streaming issue.
